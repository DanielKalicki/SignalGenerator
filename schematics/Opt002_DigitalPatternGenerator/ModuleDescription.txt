This module allows the user to generate arbitrary digital patterns on 16 output pins.
The output level can be arbitrary select from 0.2 to 10V, or choosed from preset values like 1.8V, 3.3V, 5V.
Output signal can be selected as differential or single ended using line codes like "Return-to-zero", "Non-return-to-zero", "Non-return-to-zero inverted".
